# Using F0 "source"

## Motivation

For development scenarios is necessary to be agile and be able to apply changes
in F0 and check how then integrates in the consumer (ex. factorial's monorepo)

In this scenario the regular release process (build, publish, update
dependency's version on the consumer and update) is very slow and doesn't
provide a fast feedback of the changes.

Use the `factorial-one`'s source as dependencies has a lot of tradeoffs and
issues: aliases, vite plugins, etc. needs to be configured in the same way in
the consumer of `factorial-one`

### Strategy

Building the library will be necessary to use it in the same way as in
production, but in some scenarios (like local development) we can skip
publishing and reinstalling (check how to: [in local development](#local) or
[in coder](#coder))

## How to

### Using an specific commit

Check [release and versioning](release-and-versioning.md) for more information
about the versioning and the commit and how to use it in local

> IMPORTANT: Remember to remove use a stable version before to merge into `main`
> or release

### How to use local version of `factorial-one` in your local repo (ex. `factorial`'s monorepo) {#local}

This applies when both `factorial-one` and `factorial`'s monorepo are in the
local computer

1. Go to the `factorial-one` folder: `cd factorial-one`
2. Run `pnpm build:watch` to rebuild the project on any change
3. Run `pnpm link --global` to add the package to the local links
4. Go to the factorial app monorepo: `cd factorial/frontend`
5. Run `pnpm link --global @factorialco/f0-react` to use the local version of
   the package

### How to use local version of `factorial-one` in coder {#cder}

This applies when `factorial-one` is in your local computer and `factorial`'s
monorepo is in coder's dev environment

**Prerequisites:**

- [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) in your local computer:
  `brew install rsync`
- [coder cli](https://coder.com/docs/install/cli) in your local computer
  - ![Coder ssh](images/coder.png)
- Configure coder cli if its the first time you connect by ssh:
  `coder login https://coder.factorial.dev`
- Create if not exists `packages/react/.env.local` and add this line
  `CODER_REMOTE=[YOUR_CODER_SSH_CONNECTION_STRING]`, for example:
  `CODER_REMOTE=coder.sergiocarracedo-dev-env`
  > This file is in the `.gitignore` file, so it won't be pushed to the
  > repository

**Steps:**

1. Go to the `factorial-one` folder: `cd factorial-one/packages/react`
2. Run `pnpm dev:coder` to rebuild the project on any change and sync that build
   to coder workspace
3. On the `factorial` project you may need to clean vite cache (rm -Rf
   frontend/node_modules/.vite) and restart frontend service: make
   session.frontend

> Now on each change in the `factorial-one`'s source code, the changes will be
> reflected in the coder workspace and the frontend will be reloaded using
> always the latest `factorial-one`'s code.
