# Using dataTestId

All public F0 components support a `dataTestId` prop so you can attach stable selectors for end-to-end and integration tests. The value you pass is rendered as the `data-testid` attribute on the component’s root element.

## Why use it?

- **Stable selectors**: Avoid relying on labels, classes, or DOM structure that may change.
- **Clear intent**: Test IDs make it obvious which elements are used in tests.
- **Consistent API**: The same prop works across F0 components.

## Usage

Pass `dataTestId` to any F0 component that supports it (all public components do):

```tsx
import { F0Button } from "@factorialco/f0"
;<F0Button label="Submit" dataTestId="submit-button" />
```

This renders:

```html
<button data-testid="submit-button" ...>Submit</button>
```

In your tests, query by that attribute:

```tsx
// With Testing Library
const button = screen.getByTestId("submit-button")

// Or by attribute
const button = document.querySelector('[data-testid="submit-button"]')
```

## Naming

- Use short, descriptive IDs: `submit-button`, `user-menu`, `table-row-1`.
- Prefer kebab-case: `dataTestId="date-picker-trigger"`.
- Keep IDs stable across releases so tests don’t break when copy or layout changes.

## Optional prop

`dataTestId` is optional. If you omit it, no `data-testid` attribute is rendered. Use it only where you need a test selector.

## Advanced: wrapping your own components

To add the same behavior to your own components, use the `withDataTestId` HOC from F0:

```tsx
import { withDataTestId } from "@factorialco/f0"

const MyCard = ({ children, ...props }) => <div {...props}>{children}</div>

export const MyCardWithTestId = withDataTestId(MyCard)
```

See **Library / withDataTestId** in the sidebar for the full API and examples.
