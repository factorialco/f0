# How to add a new icon

To add a new icon, you need to understand the architecture of the icons library:

The source of truth for the icons is the `packages/core/assets/icons` directory.

**This directory contains the icons in SVG format.**

There are 3 different directories in the `packages/core/assets/icons` directory:

- `app`: General purpose icons
- `modules`: Factorial's modules icons
- `ai`: Factorial's AI related icons

Those svg are consumed by the different f0 packages, for example: react-native,
react, etc.

## Icon SVG requirements

The svg files must meet the following requirements:

- The svg must be a single path.
- The icon must fit in a square (recomended 24x24px).

## Icon SVG naming convention

- The icon name must be in PascalCase.
- The name must be descriptive and concise.

## Adding a new icon

Add the SVG file to the appropriate directory in the
`packages/core/assets/icons` directory.

To generate the icons, for example for the react package, you need to run the
`pnpm generate-icons` command in the `packages/react` directory.

This will generate react components for the icons in the
`packages/react/src/icons` directory.
