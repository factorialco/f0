# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in helping us improve our platform. Your
contributions are essential to keeping F0 robust and user-friendly. Below are
several ways you can contribute to the design system, organized from small tasks
to those that require more time.

Reach us in
[#f0 Slack channel](https://factorialteam.slack.com/archives/C06QT46115K),
we are happy to support you!

## üì£ Report an issue

If you notice a bug, performance issue or if something that doesn't work as
expected, leave us an
[issue in Github](https://github.com/factorialco/f0/issues). Provide
as much context as possible, including steps to reproduce, browser information,
and screenshots if relevant.

### What to expect

Once reported, the issue will be reviewed, prioritized, and tagged. We'll notify
you if more information is needed or if it has been resolved. Do not resolve it
until the bug is confirmed, unless the issue is crystal clear.

## üîß Fix things and make small enhancements

Fixes, such as a bugs in the code, erroneous Figma library components,
mismatching Names between the code and Figma or confusing documentation sentence
changes.

Small enhancements, such as adding a new icon to the existing icon library. This
change doesn‚Äôt break existing behavior and can be confined to minimize impact
across the design system.

1. Open a [list of issues](https://github.com/factorialco/f0/issues)
   and pick any bug, or enhancement you like.
2. Claim the issue by commenting on it, then submit request with your solution.

### What to expect

We‚Äôll review it and provide feedback, or approve it if the contribution meets
the guidelines. If a design review is needed, we'll bring the designers in.
Usually it won't take much time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Make large enhancements

A large enhancement extends an existing feature, such as an alert‚Äôs
dismissibility, description, and position. Any major visual or code change is a
large contribution.

1. Claim the issue by commenting on it, share the approach you want to take
2. Get in contact with the team in #f0 channel
3. Implement the enhancement and open a PR
4. Keep repeating until done

### What to expect

Expect the process to take more time than you expect. Big changes require
thorough review of many people because they touch several zones of expertise:
design, code, accessibility and documentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Propose new pattern or component

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being
suggested would be useful and unique:

- There is evidence that this component or pattern would be useful for many
  teams or services
- It does not replicate something already in the Design System.

There is no set process on how to add new components to the F0 yet. Get in
contact with us in #f0 channel

### What to expect

It will take time and resources, since an introduction of a pattern requires all
the pieces: research, design, code, documentation, etc.
