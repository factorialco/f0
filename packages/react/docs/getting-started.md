# Getting started

## Usage

In your react project:

```bash
$ pnpm install git+https://github.com/factorialco/f0#release
```

Then, in your react files:

```tsx
// In your `main.tsx` file or any top-level component
import "@factorialco/f0/styles.css"

// If you want to use the shipped fonts
import "@factorialco/f0/fonts.js"

// In any of your components
import { Button } from "@factorialco/f0"
```

And that's it!
