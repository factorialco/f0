# Getting started

## Usage

In your react project:

```

Then, in your react files:

```tsx
// In your `main.tsx` file or any top-level component
import "@factorialco/factorial-one/styles.css"

// If you want to use the shipped fonts
import "@factorialco/factorial-one/fonts.js"

// In any of your components

```

And that's it!
