# Data collection / Status Persistence

The OneDataCollection component supports persisting user preferences and state
across sessions using the `DataCollectionStorageProvider`. This allows users to
maintain their preferred settings like filters, sorting, grouping, search terms,
and visualization preferences.

## Overview

The persistence system consists of two main parts:

- **datacollection ID**: A unique identifier that identifies the data collection
  (this will be used as the key for the storage, but for other purposes like
  state sharing via url, analytics, etc.)

- **Storage Features**: Configuration that defines which features should be
  persisted

## Storage Key

### Required Format

The storage key **must** follow the format: `{name}/{version}`

```typescript
// Valid examples
"employees/v1"
"projects/dashboard/v2"
"customers/list/v1.2"

// Invalid examples
"employees" // Missing version
"employees/1" // Version must start with 'v'
"/v1" // Empty name
"employees/v" // Version needs identifier
```

### Key Components

- **Name**: Can be a simple name or a path (e.g., `employees`,
  `projects/dashboard`)
- **Version**: Must start with 'v' followed by alphanumeric characters, but not
  dots:

  - ✅ `v1`,
  - ❌ `v2.1`, `v1.0.0`

### Why Versioning is Critical

The version part of the key is essential for handling breaking changes in your
data collection configuration. You **must** update the version when:

- **Filter definitions change**: New filters added, existing filters modified or
  removed
- **Column structure changes**: New columns added, columns renamed, or data
  types modified
- **Grouping options change**: Available grouping fields modified
- **Sorting options change**: Available sorting fields modified
- **Visualization configuration changes**: New visualizations added or existing
  ones modified

```typescript
// Initial implementation
<OneDataCollection storageKey="employees/v1" />

// After adding new filters or changing column structure
<OneDataCollection storageKey="employees/v2" />
```

Without version updates, users might experience:

- Errors when loading incompatible stored settings
- Missing or broken filter states
- Incorrect column configurations

## Storage Features

Storage features determine which aspects of the data collection state should be
persisted and restored.

### Available Features

The system supports the following storage features:

- `"filters"` - User-applied filters
- `"navigationFilters"` - Navigation-based filters
- `"sortings"` - Column sorting preferences
- `"grouping"` - Row grouping configuration
- `"visualization"` - Selected visualization type
- `"search"` - Search query terms
- `"settings"` - Component settings (always included automatically)

### Feature Configuration

#### Store All Features

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  id="employees/v1"
/>
```

or are the same

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  id="employees/v1"
  storage={{
    features: ["*"]
  }} // or ["all"] or none that means all features are stored
/>
```

#### Store Specific Features

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  id="employees/v1"
  storage={{
    features: ["filters", "sortings", "search"]
  }}
/>
```

#### Store All Except Specific Features

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  id="employees/v1"
  storage={{
    features: ["*", "!grouping", "!visualization"]
  }} // All except grouping and visualization
/>
```

#### No Persistence

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  // No id provided - no persistence
/>
```

## Implementation Example

### Basic Setup

```typescript
  <OneDataCollection
    id="employees/v1"
    storage={{
      features: ["*"]
    }}
    // ... other props
  />
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
<OneDataCollection
  id="projects/dashboard/v2"
  storage={{
    features: [
    "filters",      // Store user filters
    "sortings",     // Store column sorting
    "search",       // Store search terms
    "!grouping"     // Don't store grouping (reset each session)
    ]
  }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Management

- Start with `v1` for new implementations
- Increment version when making breaking changes to data structure
- Use semantic versioning is not allowed - ❌ `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`

### 2. Feature Selection

- Only persist features that enhance user experience
- Consider performance impact of storing large filter states
- Exclude frequently changing features that shouldn't persist

### 3. Storage Key (ID) Naming

- Use descriptive names that reflect the data and context
- Use paths for hierarchical organization
  (`[module]/[datacollection descriptive name]`) e.g.
  `organization/employees/v1`
- Keep names consistent across your application
