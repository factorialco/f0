# Data collection Grouping

## Introduction

Data collection grouping allows to group the data by a field. This is useful to
organize the data in a more readable way and to perform aggregations on the
data.

The grouping is applied in the frontend just defining whitch field is used for
the grouping. T he `useDataCollection` hook fetch thedata as is (flat), and then
the data is grouped in the frontend.

> Important: For paginated data with grouping, the data must be sorted by the
> grouping field in last term (and then other sortings can be applied) to
> warranty all the rows with the same value for the grouping fields are together
> in the list

The grouping is defined in the grouping property of the `useDataCollection`
hook.

```tsx
const { source, currentGrouping, setCurrentGrouping } = useDataCollection({
  ...
  grouping={{
    mandatory: true, // If true, the grouping is mandatory and the data will be grouped by the grouping field, if false, the grouping is optional and the use can choose not grouping the data
    collapsible: true, // If true, the grouping is collapsible and the user can collapse the grouping, if false, the grouping is non collapsible and the user cannot collapse the grouping
    initialOpenGroups: true, // If true, the grouping is open by default, if false, the grouping is closed by default, if an array, the grouping will be open only for the groups in the array
    groupBy: {
        // This is the field to group the data by
        department: {
            name: "Department", // This is the name of the group
            label: (groupId) => groupId, //
            itemCount: async (groupId) => {
                await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
                return mockUsers.filter((user) => user.department === groupId)
                .length
            },
        },
        role: {
            name: "Role",
            label: (groupId) => groupId,
            itemCount: (groupId) => {
               return mockUsers.filter((user) => user.role === groupId).length
           },
        },
    },
  },
  ...
})
```

## Grouping definition

The grouping is configured in the `grouping` property of the `useDataCollection`

```ts
export type GroupingDefinition<R extends RecordType> = {
  mandatory?: boolean
  collapsible?: boolean
  defaultOpenGroups?: boolean | string[]
  groupBy: {
    [K in keyof R]?: {
      name: string
      label: (
        groupId: R[K],
        filters: FiltersState<FiltersDefinition>
      ) => string | Promise<string>
      itemCount?: (
        groupId: R[K],
        filters: FiltersState<FiltersDefinition>
      ) => number | undefined | Promise<number | undefined>
    }
  }
}
```

### Mandatory

The `mandatory` property is used to define if the grouping is mandatory or not.
If it is mandatory, the data must be grouped by one of the grouping fields. If
it is not mandatory, the user can choose not grouping the data and still
choosing group by one of the available fields.

### Collapsible

The `collapsible` property is used to define if the grouping is collapsible or
not. If it is collapsible, the user can collapse the grouping . If it is not
collapsible, the grouping is always expanded.

### Default open groups

The `defaultOpenGroups` property is used to define the default open groups. If
it is a boolean, it will be applied to all groups. If it is an array, it will be
applied to the groups in the array. This property is only used if the grouping
is collapsible.

### GroupBy

The `groupBy` property is used to define the grouping fields. Each key is a
field of the record and the value is an object with the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the grouping (used in the UI to select the how to group
  the data). e.g 'Department'.
- `label`: The label of of a group, used to show the group title. e.g 'Sales'.
  This function receives the group id (e.g. 123, which is the department id) and
  the current filters state, and it returns the label to show or a promise. In
  the case of a promise the datacollection will render a skeleton until the
  promise is resolved. you can use this to fetch the label from an api, array,
  etc.
- `itemCount`: The count of elements in a group. This function receives the
  group id (e.g. 123, which is the department id) and the current filters state,
  and it returns the item count of the group or a promise. In the case of a
  promise the datacollection will render a skeleton until the promise is
  resolved. you can use this to fetch the item count from an api, array, etc.
