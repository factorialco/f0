# Data collection / Callbacks

The callbacks are functions that are called when the state of the data collection changes.

## onStateChange

The `onStateChange` callback is called when the state of the data collection changes.

```tsx
<OneDataCollection onStateChange={handleStateChange} />
```

<Canvas of={CallbacksStories.Default} meta={CallbacksStories} />
