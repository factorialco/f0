# Value Display

## Introduction

In order to provide a homogeneous experience to the customers and abstract the
render logic to developer using the `ValueDisplay` components,

ValueDisplay provides a semantic way to define the value's display of a
property.

The way a cell/property must be rendered is defined in the `render` function of
the datacollection, the type is the cell type to render and the value depends on
that type

### Data types

Data Collection supports various data types, each with an optimized
visualization designed for specific use cases. These visualizations fall into
several categories:

- **Text-based:** Simple text presentations like labels, which can be enhanced
  with icons or formatting for different contexts.
- **Identity**: Visual representations for entities such as people, companies,
  and teams, typically using avatars with initials or images.
- **Metadata**: Specialized formats for information like dates, documents, and
  currency values.
- **Status**: Visual indicators showing state, alerts, etc.
- **Collections**: Compact visualizations for multiple related items, such as
  team members or tags.
- **Data Visualization**: Simple charts and graphs that represent data patterns
  directly in cells.
