# Data collection

## Introduction

### Definition

The Data Collection component is designed to standardize and optimize the
visualization and manipulation of data across the platform. It provides a more
intuitive, flexible experience that supports different ways to view data,
primarily through table, card, and list formats.

### Purpose

- **Unify the data experience:** Create a consistent and predictable experience
  for users when interacting with data across the application.
- **Simplify complexity:** Automatically manage the technical aspects of data
  presentation, allowing users to focus on the information.
- **Improve efficiency:** Enable quick analysis and optimize workflows with
  filtering, sorting, contextual visualization, and bulk actions.
- **Scale with data:** Maintain performance and usability with both small
  datasets and large volumes of information.

## Anatomy

The component is designed to be extensible, allowing new cell types to be added
as needed while maintaining consistent behavior patterns within these
categories.

### Toolbar

#### Settings

The settings panel allows users to configure how data is displayed. The
component offers two main viewing options: Table view and card view.
