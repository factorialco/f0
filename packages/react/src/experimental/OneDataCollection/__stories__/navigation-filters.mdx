# Data collection/Navigation filters

## Introduction

### Definition

Navigation filters are filters that are used to filter the data in correlative
chunksin the collection but they are not the same as the filters. Opposite to
the filters those are not mandatory, navigation filters are mandatory (data
always must be filtered by the navigation filter value(s)). Navigation filters
also allow to navigate to the next or previous chunk of data.

They are displayed in the top left of the collection. For example, a date
navigator is a filter that allows you to filter the data by date, and using the
arrow keys you can navigate through the dates.

### Usage

Navigation filters are defined on the `navigationFilters` prop of the
`useDataSource` hook.

#### Example

```tsx
const dataSource = useDataSource({
  navigationFilters: {
    date: {
      type: "date-navigator",
      defaultValue: new Date(),
      granularity: ["day"],
      min: new Date(),
      max: addDays(new Date(), 1),
    },
  },
})
```

As the navigation filters are not nullable the initial value is mandatory. The
`options` property depends on the type of the navigation filter.

The current value of the filter is passed to the `dataAdapter.fetchData`
function on the `useDataSource` hook as `filterValues` parameter.

```tsx
const dataSource = useDataSource({
  dataAdapter: {
    fetchData: ({ filters, navigationFilters }) =>
      fetchData(filters, navigationFilters),
  },
})
```

#### Why is not a regular filter?

We decided to keep this filter separate from the regular filters because it has
a different semantics. But you can use it as a regular filter.

## DateNavigation (type: "date-navigator")

The DateNavigation filter is a navigation filter that allows you to filter the
data by date defining a granularity (day, week, month, year) or a custom range
of dates.

Except for a custom range of dates, user is choosing the minimun date chuck the
granularity represents, but this can be translated into a range of dates
(datetimes).

With this criteria, a week is a range of 7 days (staring on the first day of the
week at 00:00:00 and ending on the last day of the week at 23:59:59), a month is
a range of 30 days (staring on the first day of the month at 00:00:00 and ending
on the last day of the month at 23:59:59), etc.

### Options

- `granularity`: The granularity of the date navigation filter. It can be a
  single value or an array of values. if is an array with more than one item,
  the filter will be displayed as a select with the available granularities.
- `defaultGranularity`: The default granularity of the date navigation filter.
  It is used when the filter is created.
- `min`: The minimum date of the date navigation filter.
- `max`: The maximum date of the date navigation filter.

### Example

```tsx
const dataSource = useDataSource({
  navigationFilters: {
    date: {
      type: "date-navigator",
      defaultValue: {
        date: new Date(),
        granularity: "week",
      },
      granularity: ["day", "week", "month", "year"],
      min: new Date(),
      max: addDays(new Date(), 1),
    },
  },
})
```

### dataFetch values

The DateNavigation pass to the `dataFetch` function the following values via
`navigationFilters` property:

- `value`: A range of dates in days that represents the current value of the
  date navigation filter.
- `valueString`: The string representation of the current value of the date
  navigation filter.
- `granularity`: The granularity of the date navigation filter.

### Add a new granularity

If you need to add a new granularity level, you can add a new granularity
definition in the `granularityDefinitions` object in the file
`OneCalendar/granularities/index.tsx`.

### Examples

#### Default / Day granularity

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.Default}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>

#### Week granularity

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.WeekGranularity}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>

#### Month granularity

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.MonthGranularity}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>

#### Year granularity

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.YearGranularity}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>

#### Custom range

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.CustomGranularity}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>

#### Multiple granularities

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories.MultipleGranularities}
  meta={DataCollectionNavigationFiltersStories}
/>
