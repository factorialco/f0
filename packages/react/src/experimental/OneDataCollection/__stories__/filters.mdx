# Data collection Filters

## Introduction

Filtering allows users to define custom filtering criteria by selecting options
from various categories through the dropdown panel.

### Filtering Panel

It is activated by clicking on the funnel icon. Once activated, a panel is
displayed with:

- Filter categories (team, workplace, job title, etc.)
- List of options within each category
- A search field to quickly find specific options
- Selection and action buttons.
- Calendar
  - Month and year selector with navigation arrows for browsing different time
    periods
  - Weekly view with day headers (Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su)
  - Selectable days for choosing specific dates
  - Date range selector with "from" and "to" fields
  - Option to either select dates directly on the calendar or enter them
    manually

### Chips

When a filter is applied, the system generates "chips" that:

- Accumulate from left to right at the bottom of the presets and filtering
  section
- Show the user exactly which filters are active
- Include the category name and the selected value
- Include a close icon (X) that allows the user to remove that specific filter
  with a single click
- Remain active until the user explicitly removes them.

### Presets

Presets are predefined filter combinations. For example, if you have a
department filter, you can create a preset to show only the Engineering team

Filters related types are defined in the <LinkTo kind="Components/FiltersPicker" story="Documentation">FiltersPicker
documentation</LinkTo> component.

## Setting Filters, presets and use them in the data source

To enable filters in your data collection component, supply the filter attribute
in the source prop, for the presets use the presets attribute, remember you need
to define the filters first and apply a preset over an existing filter.

Example:

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  department: {
    type: "in",
    label: "Department",
    options: {
      options: [
        { value: "Engineering", label: "Engineering" },
        { value: "Marketing", label: "Marketing" },
        // â€¦
      ],
    },
  },
  search: { type: "search", label: "Search" },
  date: { type: "date", label: "Date" },
} as const

const presets: PresetsDefinition<typeof filters> = [
  { label: "Engineering Only", filter: { department: ["Engineering"] } },
  { label: "Product Team", filter: { department: ["Product"] } },
]
```

```tsx
<OneDataCollection
  source={{
    // ...
    filters,
    presets,
    dataAdapter: {
        fetchData: fetchData({ filters: newFilters }) {
            //... your code to featch the data
        }
      },
  }}
/>
```

### Reading Filter Values

The `dataAdapter.fetchData` function receives the current filters as an
argument, independently if the filter was set manually or by a preset.

Check the component <LinkTo kind="Components/FiltersPicker" story="Documentation">FiltersPicker
documentation</LinkTo> for more details about the filters types.

### Search

The search bar is a tool that facilitates locating data within the table. Its
main function is to allow users to find specific information quickly and
efficiently.

- **Collapsible and expandable**: The search field is hidden when not in use and
  expands when activated.
- **Real-time search**: As the user types, the results are dynamically updated.
- **Row filtering**: Only rows that match the search criteria are displayed,
  hiding those that are not relevant.
