# Data collection Filters

## Introduction

Filters let users narrow down the results in the data collection by one or more
criteria. They appear in the top right corner of the collection toolbar.

## Presets

Presets are predefined filter combinations. For example, if you have a
department filter, you can create a preset to show only the Engineering team

## Setting Filters, presets and use them in the data source

To enable filters in your data collection component, supply the filter attribute
in the source prop, for the presets use the presets attribute, remember you need
to define the filters first and apply a preset over an existing filter.

Example:

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  department: {
    type: "in",
    label: "Department",
    options: [
      { value: "Engineering", label: "Engineering" },
      { value: "Marketing", label: "Marketing" },
      // â€¦
    ],
  },
  search: { type: "search", label: "Search" },
  date: { type: "date", label: "Date" },
} as const

const presets: PresetsDefinition<typeof filters> = [
  { label: "Engineering Only", filter: { department: ["Engineering"] } },
  { label: "Product Team", filter: { department: ["Product"] } },
]
```

````tsx
<OneDataCollection
  source={{
    // ...
    filters,
    presets,
    dataAdapter: {
        fetchData: fetchData({ filters: newFilters }) {
            //... your code to featch the data
        }
      },
  }}
/>


### Reading Filter Values

The `dataAdapter.fetchData` function receives the current filters as an argument,
independently if the filter was set manually or by a preset.

## Filter Types

### In

The `in` filter is used to filter the data by a list of values.

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  department: { type: "in", label: "Department", options: [
    { value: "Engineering", label: "Engineering" },
    { value: "Marketing", label: "Marketing" },
    // ...
  ] },
}
````

This returns an array of values, so the data adapter will receive an array of
values to filter the data.

### Date

The `date` filter is used to filter the data by a date value. The filter allows
limit user select to a min and max date.

#### Options

- `minDate?`: The minimum date that the user can select.
- `maxDate?`: The maximum date that the user can select.
- `mode?`: The mode of the date filter, can be `single` (default), `range` or
  `multiple`.
- `view?`: The view of the date filter, can be `day` (default), `week`, `month`
  or `year`.

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  date: {
    type: "date",
    label: "Date",
    options: {
      minDate: new Date("2021-01-01"),
      maxDate: new Date("2021-12-31"),
      mode: "range",
      view: "day",
    },
  },
}
```

### Search

The `search` filter is used to filter the data by a search query.

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  search: { type: "search", label: "Search" },
}
```

## Adding a new filter type to the data collection

Data Collection provides a modular system to add new filter types easily.

To add a new filter type follow these steps:

1. Create a folder in the `OneDataCollection/filters/FilterTypes` folder. (e.g.
   `OneDataCollection/filters/FilterTypes/myFilterType`)

2. Create a `index.tsx` file in the new folder and export the filter type
   definition.

```tsx
export const myFilter: FilterTypeDefinition<number> = {
  // The empty value is the value returned when the filter is not set
  emptyValue: 0,
  // The render function is used to render the filter form that allows the user to set the filter value
  render: (props) => <MyFilterForm {...props} />,
  // The isEmpty function is used to check if the filter is empty
  isEmpty: (value) => value === undefined || value === 0,
  // The chipLabel function is used to label the filter in the chip
  chipLabel: (value) => value.toString() ?? "-",
}

export type MyFilterDefinition = BaseFilterDefinition<"myFilter">
```

3. Import the new filter type in the `OneDataCollection/filters/filters.ts` file
   and add it to the `filterTypes` object.

```tsx
import { myFilter, MyFilterDefinition } from "./FilterTypes/myFilter"

export const filterTypes = {
  in: inFilter,
  search: searchFilter,
  date: dateFilter,
  ...
  myFilter: myFilter,
} as const

```

4. Add the new filter type to the `FilterDefinitionsByType` type.

```tsx
export type FilterDefinitionsByType = {
  ...
  myFilter: MyFilterDefinition,
}
```

5. Add the new filter type to the `filters` object.

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  myFilter: myFilter,
}
```

5. Add the new filter type Value to the `FilterValue` type.

```tsx
export type FilterValue<T extends FilterDefinition> =
  T extends InFilterDefinition<infer U>
    ? U[]
    : T extends SearchFilterDefinition
      ? string
      : T extends DateFilterDefinition
        ? Date
        : T extends MyFilterDefinition
          ? number
          : never
```
