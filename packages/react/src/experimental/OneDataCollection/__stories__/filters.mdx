# Data collection Filters

## Introduction

Filters let users narrow down the results in the dataset by one or more
criteria.

## Presets

Presets are predefined filter combinations. For example, if you have a
department filter, you can create a preset to show only the Engineering team

Filters related types are defined in the <LinkTo kind="Components/FiltersPicker" story="Documentation">FiltersPicker
documentation</LinkTo> component.

## Setting Filters, presets and use them in the data source

To enable filters in your data collection component, supply the filter attribute
in the source prop, for the presets use the presets attribute, remember you need
to define the filters first and apply a preset over an existing filter.

Example:

```tsx
const filters: FiltersDefinition<typeof mockUsers> = {
  department: {
    type: "in",
    label: "Department",
    options: {
      options: [
        { value: "Engineering", label: "Engineering" },
        { value: "Marketing", label: "Marketing" },
        // â€¦
      ],
    },
  },
  search: { type: "search", label: "Search" },
  date: { type: "date", label: "Date" },
} as const

const presets: PresetsDefinition<typeof filters> = [
  { label: "Engineering Only", filter: { department: ["Engineering"] } },
  { label: "Product Team", filter: { department: ["Product"] } },
]
```

```tsx
<OneDataCollection
  source={{
    // ...
    filters,
    presets,
    dataAdapter: {
        fetchData: fetchData({ filters: newFilters }) {
            //... your code to featch the data
        }
      },
  }}
/>
```

### Reading Filter Values

The `dataAdapter.fetchData` function receives the current filters as an
argument, independently if the filter was set manually or by a preset.
