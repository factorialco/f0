# Data collection / Loading

The component displays a visual loading state while data is being retrieved or
processed, providing the user with instant feedback on the progress of the
operation.

## Behaviour

The loading state is automatically triggered when the component performs
asynchronous data fetching or processing operations.

During loading, each items shows a skeleton loading indicator that maintains the
original dimensions.

When reloading data (through filters or pagination), the content fades out and a
spinner appears in the visualization.
