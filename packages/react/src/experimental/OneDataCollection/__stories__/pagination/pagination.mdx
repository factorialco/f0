# Data collection / Pagination

The pagination automatically divides datasets into pages after reaching a predefined number of rows,
we recommend 20 items per page. This mechanism improves performance and usability when working with
large volumes of information.

## Behaviour

When the total number of items exceeds the page limit, the system generates multiple navigable
pages. However, when all the items fit on a single page, the pagination interface remains visible
but adopts a disabled state.

## Pages

This is the default pagination method. It divides data into discrete pages (e.g., 20 items per page)
and provides navigation controls to jump between them. It’s ideal for datasets where clear
segmentation and predictable performance are needed. The pagination bar remains visible even when
all items fit in a single page (but appears disabled).

## Infinite scroll

Infinite scroll loads additional data automatically as the user scrolls down. This creates a
continuous, fluid browsing experience without explicit page navigation. It’s especially useful for
large datasets and scenarios where the user is expected to consume data in a linear, exploratory
manner. A skeleton loader or spinner appears near the bottom to indicate loading progress.

> Important: Infinite scroll requires the table (or main visualization wrapper) to be rendered
> inside a container with a fixed height and overflow: auto. This is essential to detect scroll
> events or trigger the intersection observer used for loading more data.

> Important: Required to provide an `idProvider` to the `source` prop if the record type does not
> have an `id` property (default behavior). This is required to avoid duplicate items when appending
> data.
>
> Example:
>
> ```tsx
> const dataSource: DataSource = {
>   idProvider: (item, index) => item.myId,
>   ...
> }
> ```

```tsx
<div style={{ height: '900px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
  <OneDataCollection
    source={dataSource}
    visualizations={[{ type: 'table', options: { columns: [...] } }]}
  />
</div>
```
