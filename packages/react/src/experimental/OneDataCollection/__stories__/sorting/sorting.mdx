# Data collection / Sorting

Sorting in a data table allows users to organize the information in ascending or
descending order. By clicking on a column header, the data is sorted in
ascending order (A-Z or smallest to largest). A second click reverses the order
(Z-A or largest to smallest), and a third click restores the original order.

If a different column is selected, the sorting of the previous column is
canceled, and the new cycle starts from ascending order. Only one column can be
sorted at a time.

The sorting behavior depends on the data type: for text, it is sorted
alphabetically; for numbers, it is sorted from smallest to largest or vice
versa; and for dates, it is sorted chronologically.
