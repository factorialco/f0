# Data collection / Sorting

Sorting in a data table allows users to organize the information in ascending or descending order.
By clicking on a column header, the data is sorted in ascending order (A-Z or smallest to largest).
A second click reverses the order (Z-A or largest to smallest), and a third click restores the
original order.

If a different column is selected, the sorting of the previous column is canceled, and the new cycle
starts from ascending order. Only one column can be sorted at a time.

The sorting behavior depends on the data type: for text, it is sorted alphabetically; for numbers,
it is sorted from smallest to largest or vice versa; and for dates, it is sorted chronologically.
