# Avatar Name Selector

## Introduction

### Definition

The AvatarNameSelector is a versatile form component that enables users to
select one or multiple entities (such as users, teams, or other named items)
from a searchable, filterable list. Each entity is represented by an avatar and
a name, providing visual recognition and clear identification.

### Purpose

- Provide an intuitive interface for selecting users, teams, or other named
  entities with visual identifiers
- Support both single and multiple selection modes for flexible use cases
- Enable quick navigation through large datasets with built-in search
  functionality
- Organize entities in hierarchical groups with expandable sections for better
  organization
- Maintain selection state across different views and group filters

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />

The AvatarNameSelector consists of several key elements:

### Common elements

#### Trigger

- Displays the current selection state (empty, single item, or count)
- Shows avatar and name for single selections
- Includes a dropdown indicator for accessing the selection interface

#### Search field

- Enables quick filtering of available options
- Supports instant search with debounced updates
- Maintains search state while the selector is open

#### Group selector

- Allows switching between different entity groupings
- Supports custom group types (e.g., "avatar", "team")
- Updates the view while preserving selections

#### Selection list

- Displays entities with avatars and names
- Supports hierarchical display with expandable items
- Shows selection state (selected, partially selected)
- Virtualizes long lists for performance

#### Action buttons

- "Select All" for bulk selection of visible items
- "Clear" to remove all visible selections
- Contextual actions based on selection mode

## Variants

### With Selected Groups

Demonstrates the component's ability to handle hierarchical data structures,
showing entities organized into groups with parent-child relationships.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithSelectedGroup} />

### Single Selection

A simplified version that allows selecting only one entity at a time, ideal for
picking a single user or team.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.SingleSelector} />

### Always Open Mode

A variant that remains expanded, suitable for forms or settings where constant
visibility is desired.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.AlwaysOpen} />

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Use clear, recognizable avatars to help with visual identification
- Keep entity names concise and descriptive
- Provide meaningful group labels that reflect the organizational structure
- Include search keywords to improve findability

### Design best practices

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description: "Use AvatarNameSelector when:",
    guidelines: [
      "Users need to select from a list of people or teams",
      "Visual identification through avatars is helpful",
      "The dataset is large and requires search/filtering",
      "Items have a natural hierarchical structure",
      "Multiple selections need to be managed efficiently",
    ],
    children: null,
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use AvatarNameSelector when:",
    guidelines: [
      "The selection list is very small (use radio buttons or checkboxes instead)",
      "Visual identification isn't important for the items",
      "The data has no natural grouping or hierarchy",
      "Real-time selection updates aren't needed",
      "The selection process needs to be extremely simple",
    ],
    children: null,
  }}
/>

### Layout

- Position the component with sufficient space for the dropdown
- Consider the expanded state height when placing in forms
- Allow enough width for long entity names
- Maintain consistent spacing between list items
- Ensure the search field is easily accessible

## Usage

The AvatarNameSelector can be implemented in both single and multiple selection
modes:

```tsx
import { AvatarNameSelector } from "@factorial/react"

// Single selection
const SingleSelector = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<AvatarNamedEntity | null>(null)

  return (
    <AvatarNameSelector
      singleSelector
      entities={entities}
      selectedAvatarName={selected ? [selected] : []}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      groups={[{ label: "All", value: "all", type: "avatar" }]}
      selectedGroup="all"
      triggerPlaceholder="Select a user..."
      triggerSelected="selected"
      searchPlaceholder="Search users..."
    />
  )
}

// Multiple selection
const MultiSelector = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<AvatarNamedEntity[]>([])

  return (
    <AvatarNameSelector
      entities={entities}
      selectedAvatarName={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      groups={[
        { label: "All", value: "all", type: "avatar" },
        { label: "Teams", value: "teams", type: "team" },
      ]}
      selectedGroup="all"
      triggerPlaceholder="Select users..."
      triggerSelected="users selected"
      searchPlaceholder="Search..."
    />
  )
}
```
