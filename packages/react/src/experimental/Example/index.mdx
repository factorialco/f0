# ExampleTest

The ExampleTest component is a simple calculator that demonstrates how to create
and test interactive components in Storybook. This is an experimental component
used primarily for demonstration purposes.

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={ExampleTestStories.Default} />
<Controls of={ExampleTestStories.Default} />

## Usage

### Import

Import the ExampleTest component from the experimental package:

```tsx
import { ExampleTest } from "@factorialco/factorial-one/experimental/Example"
```

### Basic Usage

The component provides a simple interface for adding two numbers:

```tsx
<ExampleTest />
```

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description:
      "Use the component to demonstrate interactive testing in Storybook.",
    code: `
      <ExampleTest />
    `,
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Use this component in production - it's just an example.",
    code: `
      // Don't use in production code
      import { ExampleTest } from "@factorialco/factorial-one/experimental/Example"
    `,
  }}
/>

## Edge Cases

The component handles various edge cases:

### Negative Numbers

<Canvas of={ExampleTestStories.NegativeNumbers} />

The component correctly handles negative numbers, allowing users to input and
calculate with negative values.

### Decimal Numbers

<Canvas of={ExampleTestStories.DecimalNumbers} />

When working with decimal numbers, the component performs the calculation and
displays the result.

### Empty Inputs

<Canvas of={ExampleTestStories.EmptyInputs} />

If no numbers are entered, the component defaults to 0 for empty inputs.

### Large Numbers

<Canvas of={ExampleTestStories.LargeNumbers} />

The component can handle large numbers within JavaScript's safe integer limits.
