# F0ButtonToggle

## Purpose of this document

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for designers and developers
on using the F0ButtonToggle component, including design specifications,
interaction patterns, and implementation details.

## Introduction

### Definition

The F0ButtonToggle is a two-state button component that allows users to switch
between two modes or states. It functions similarly to a checkbox but with a
more prominent visual representation suitable for primary actions.

### Purpose

- Provide binary state control for user preferences or settings
- Enable quick switching between two related modes (e.g., microphone on/off)
- Offer clear visual feedback for the current state
- Support accessibility requirements for toggle interactions

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={F0ButtonToggleStories.Default} meta={F0ButtonToggleStories} />
<Controls of={F0ButtonToggleStories.Default} />

The F0ButtonToggle consists of:

1. **Container**: The button boundary that responds to user interaction
2. **Icon Area**: Visual indicator that changes based on state
3. **Label**: Accessible text description (hidden visually but available to
   screen readers)
4. **State Indicator**: Visual feedback showing current selected/unselected
   state

### Interactive States

- **Default**: Unselected state with primary styling
- **Selected**: Active state with emphasized styling
- **Disabled**: Non-interactive state with reduced opacity
- **Hover**: Enhanced visual feedback on mouse over
- **Focus**: Keyboard navigation indicator

## Variants

### Single Icon

Use when the same icon represents both states, with visual styling indicating
the current state.

### Dual Icon

Use when different icons better represent the two states (e.g., microphone
on/off, visibility toggle).

### Size Variants

Available sizes:

- **sm**: Compact toggle for dense interfaces
- **md**: Standard size for most use cases
- **lg**: Prominent toggle for primary actions

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Labels should clearly describe the action or state
- Use consistent icon metaphors that users understand
- Provide immediate visual feedback when state changes
- Ensure the purpose is clear from context

    description: "Use F0ButtonToggle when:",
    guidelines: [
      "You need binary state control (on/off, enabled/disabled)",
      "The state change is immediate and doesn't require confirmation",
      "Users need clear visual feedback about the current state",
      "The toggle represents a primary or frequently used action",
    ],
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use F0ButtonToggle when:",
    guidelines: [
      "Multiple options are available (use radio buttons or select)",
      "The action requires confirmation (use a regular button)",
      "The state is temporary or doesn't persist",
      "Complex logic or validation is needed before state change",
    ],
  }}
