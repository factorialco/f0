# Button

## Introduction

### Definition

The Button is a core UI component that allows users to trigger actions and
navigate to different parts of the application. It establishes visual hierarchy
to highlight the most important actions in each workflow while ensuring
consistency and accessibility.

### Purpose

- **Visual hierarchy**: Highlight the most important actions in each workflow
- **Consistent interaction**: Ensure consistent behavior and appearance across
  all areas
- **Accessibility**: Provide inclusive sizes, contrasts, and states for all
  users
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to multiple use cases from primary flows to contextual
  actions

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />
<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />

- **Label**: The main text describing the action
- **Icon**: (Optional) Visual symbol to reinforce the action
- **States**: Default, Hover, Pressed, Disabled, Loading
- **Variants**: Visual styles for different contexts (primary, secondary, ghost,
  etc.)
- **Sizes**: Small, Medium, Large

## Variants

### Type

Buttons adapt to different use cases and visual hierarchies:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Variants} />

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Variant</th>
      <th align="left">Description</th>
      <th align="left">Properties</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Default</td>
      <td>
        Is the main, highlighted action used for the most important user tasks.
        Should only appear once per screen.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="default"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Outline</td>
      <td>Has a subtle, minimal style and is used for secondary actions.</td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="outline"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral</td>
      <td>
        Represents tertiary or less important options within the interface but
        offers an extra level of hierarchy.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="neutral"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ghost</td>
      <td>
        Is for secondary actions, blending subtly with content and standing out
        only on hover or focus.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="ghost"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Critical</td>
      <td>
        Has a warning color scheme and is used for destructive actions that
        require user confirmation (e.g., delete or remove).
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="critical"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Promote</td>
      <td>
        Indicates actions related to upselling, such as offering higher-value
        products or upgrades to existing customers.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>variant="promote"</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Type</th>
      <th align="left">Description</th>
      <th align="left">Properties</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>With icon</td>
      <td>
        Combines an icon with descriptive text for better clarity and
        recognition.
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Only icon</td>
      <td>
        Buttons that contain only an icon without visible text. Useful for
        toolbars or compact actions.
      </td>
      <td>icon, hideLabel, round</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Only emoji</td>
      <td>
        A special case of icon-only button, using an emoji as the icon. Useful
        for playful or expressive actions.
      </td>
      <td>emoji, hideLabel, round</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Sizes

      <th align="left">Description</th>
      <th align="left">Properties</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>lg (40)</td>
      <td>Designed for mobile devices as they require a larger touch area.</td>
      <td>variant="lg"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>md (32)</td>
      <td>Standard size for desktop, used in most cases.</td>
      <td>variant="md"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sm (24)</td>
      <td>
        Perfect for secondary actions on desktop, such as buttons in tables,
        selectors, etc., where space is more limited.
      </td>
      <td>variant="sm"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### States

Buttons can appear in different visual and functional states, each communicating
an intention or restriction to the user.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">State</th>
      <th align="left">Description</th>
      <th align="left">Properties</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Pressed</td>
      <td>Represents the active or selected state of the button.</td>
      <td>pressed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Disabled</td>
      <td>The button is inactive and does not respond to user interaction.</td>
      <td>disabled</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Loading</td>
      <td>Indicates that an action is in progress.</td>
      <td>loading</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

###### Async Loading

Demonstrates a real asynchronous action: the button enters a loading state after
being clicked and provides feedback to the user.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AsyncLoading} />

##### Best practices:

- Use the disabled state to prevent invalid actions, not just for visual
  deactivation.
- The loading state blocks interaction until the action is complete.
- Provide clear feedback after asynchronous actions (e.g., show a success or
  error message).

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Use clear, concise, and actionable language for button labels.
- Ensure button labels are consistent with the associated action or
  functionality.
- Be specific and actionable
  - ✅ **Correct:** "Create employee", "Submit request", "Download report"
  - ❌ **Incorrect:** "OK", "Send", "Do"
- Use imperative verbs
  - ✅ **Correct:** "Save changes", "Delete account", "Export data"
  - ❌ **Incorrect:** "Saved", "Deletion", "Exportation"

### Design best practices

#### When to use

- Use buttons whenever you need the user to trigger an action or navigate to a
  different part of the application.
- Choose the appropriate button type based on the importance and context of the
  action.
- Utilize the different button variants to create a clear visual hierarchy and
  guide the user's attention.
- Only one primary button per section or screen on the right.

#### How to use

- Position the most important actions as **Primary** buttons, with less crucial
  actions as **Outline** or **Neutral** buttons.
- Use the **Ghost** button type sparingly, as it can be less visually prominent.
- Avoid using the **Critical** button type for anything other than truly
  destructive actions that require user confirmation.
- Consider adding icons to buttons when they can enhance recognition and
  usability, but don't overuse icons.
- Ensure that button sizes are consistent within the same context, following the
  recommended size guidelines.
- Always provide a **disabled** state for buttons that may become unavailable
  based on user actions or application state.
