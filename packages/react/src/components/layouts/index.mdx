## Introduction

### Definition

Layouts are structural templates that define how content is organized and
presented on a page. They provide consistent containers that determine the
overall arrangement of UI elements while respecting design system rules for
spacing, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy. Layouts serve as the foundation
upon which more specific components and content blocks are placed.

### Purpose

The purpose of layouts in our design system is as follows:

- **Consistency**: Ensures visual and structural uniformity throughout the
  application.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes development through standardized and reusable
  containers and provide with established patterns for content layout.
- **Separation of concerns**: Establishes clear boundaries between content
  structure and presentation.
- **Adaptability**: Ensures proper display across different screen sizes and
  devices.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various content organization methods without
  requiring custom CSS.

## Types of layouts

The layouts in our design system exclusively control the behavior of the
container, establishing the overall page structure. They do not dictate the
specific arrangement of elements within the sections they define, allowing
flexibility in content organization while maintaining a consistent structure.

### StandardLayout

The default layout used throughout the application when no specific layout is
specified.

**When to use it:**

- For most standard content pages
- When content needs to flow in a simple top-to-bottom arrangement
- When content requires standard page padding

**Key Features:**

- Applies page padding according to design specifications.
- Content blocks are stacked vertically and flow naturally from top to bottom.
- The container scrolls automatically when content exceeds the viewport.
- No manual content positioning control is needed.

### TwoColumnLayout

Structure the content into two distinct areas: a primary column for essential
content and a secondary column for supplementary information.

**When to use it:**

- On detail pages that need to display related but independent information
- For interfaces that require separating contextual navigation from the main
  content
- When you need to present actions or auxiliary information alongside the main
  content

**Key Features:**

- The main column can be positioned on the left or right to fit patterns like
  notification panels or anchor menus
- Default configuration: primary column on the left, secondary column on the
  right
- Padding is applied independently to each column, not the overall layout
- Columns automatically occupy the full available height
- Each column functions as an independent StandardLayout, maintaining its
  vertical flow properties

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the same layout for similar content types
2. **Minimal customization**: Avoid overriding layout behaviors with custom CSS
3. **Content flow**: Consider the natural reading order when arranging content
