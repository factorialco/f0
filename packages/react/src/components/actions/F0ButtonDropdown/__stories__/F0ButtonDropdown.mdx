# F0ButtonDropdown

## Introduction

### Definition

The F0ButtonDropdown is an action button component that combines a primary
action with a dropdown menu for additional related actions. It allows users to
execute the most common action directly while providing access to alternative
actions through a dropdown interface.

### Purpose

- Provide quick access to the most common action while offering related
  alternatives
- Reduce visual clutter by consolidating multiple related actions into a single
  component
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy with a prominent primary action
- Support efficient workflows where users frequently switch between related
  actions

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={F0ButtonDropdownStories.Default} meta={F0ButtonDropdownStories} />
<Controls of={F0ButtonDropdownStories.Default} />

The component consists of two main parts:

### Primary action button

- Displays the currently selected action with its label and optional icon
- Executes the action when clicked
- Takes visual prominence as the main interactive element

### Dropdown trigger

- Located immediately to the right of the primary button
- Shows a chevron down icon to indicate expandable content
- Opens a dropdown menu with alternative actions when clicked

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Action labels should be concise and action-oriented (2-4 words)
- Use consistent verb + noun format (e.g., "Add item", "Replace content")
- Group related actions that users would logically switch between
- Place the most common or important action first in the items array

### Design best practices

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description: "Use this component when:",
    guidelines: [
      "You have multiple related actions where one is primary",
      "Users frequently switch between similar actions",
      "You want to reduce toolbar clutter",
      "Actions share the same context or target",
    ],
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use this component when:",
    guidelines: [
      "Actions are unrelated or serve different purposes",
      "You only have one action available",
      "The dropdown would contain more than 5-6 items",
      "Users rarely switch between the available actions",
    ],
  }}
/>

### Behavior

- The first item in the items array becomes the default primary action
- Clicking the primary button executes the currently selected action
- Clicking the dropdown arrow reveals alternative actions
- Selecting an alternative action makes it the new primary action
- The component maintains the selected action state internally
- Supports keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility

### Layout

- The dropdown arrow is visually connected to the primary button
- Alternative actions appear in a dropdown menu aligned to the button
- Icons are optional but should be consistent across all items when used
- The component adapts to different sizes while maintaining proportions
