# Introduction

Factorial One is a reboot of the visual language of the Factorial platform. It's
main goal is to provide consistency and coherence to Factorial's user interface,
while enabling a fast, efficient and enjoyable user experience.

## Why Factorial One?

Over the years, Factorial has grown into a complex platform with a wide range of
features and functionalities. This complexity has led to a fragmented user
experience, with different parts of the platform having different visual styles
and interactions.

This complexity has made it increasingly difficult to maintain and scale both
our user experience and our codebase. This is holding us back and we find
ourselves spending an un reasonable amount of time time fixing bugs and
inconsistencies when we should be focusing on fixing our user's pains and
improving the platform.

## Why rebooting our design system?

Our current design system, also known as "Gamma", is built on top of a very
informally set of constraints, which hasn't stood the test of time. We keep
adding new components and styles, bout our foundations are rotten.

After many attempts, we've come to the conclusion that we need to start from
scratch and draw a clear line in the sand that separates our old design rules
and patterns from the new ones.

These are some of the opportunities we see in rebooting our design system:

- **Establish a clear vision**: A design system is only useful if we see it as a
  system of constraints. Over time, we've been adding more and more components
  and styles, without a clear vision of what we want to achieve, to the point
  where the added complexity has rendered it unusable.
- **Fully responsive**: By providing the right set of abstractions, we want to
  make it easy to build responsive interfaces that work well on any device. This
  should help us build a responsive web application that complements our mobile
  application and provides a consistent experience, without having to do the
  same work twice (unless we want to!).
- **Usable by external developers**: We want to make it easy for external
  developers to build applications on top of Factorial. By providing a set of
  well-documented and easy-to-use components, we can make it easier for them to
  build applications that live within Factorial's ecosystem, seamlessly.
- **Accessible**: We want to make sure that our platform is usable by everyone,
  regardless of their abilities. This means making sure that our components are
  accessible and that our platform is usable by everyone.
- **Robust**: We want to make sure everything in Factorial One is top notch and
  a pleasure to use. This means making sure our components are well-tested and
  that our user experience stays consistent and coherent.

## Principles

- **Consistent**: Factorial's enormous feature set can be overwhelming. By
  providing a consistent visual language, we can help users navigate the
  platform more easily and translate previous experiences to into future ones.
- **Efficient**: Factorial One is designed to be efficient. It should help users
  complete their tasks quickly and without friction.
- **Enjoyable**: We want users to enjoy using Factorial, and Factorial One is a
  key part of that. By providing a visually pleasing and coherent experience, we
  can make sure users enjoy using our platform.

## Technical choices

Factorial One is built on top of the following technologies:

- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: Factorial One is a collection of React
  components that can be used to build Factorial's user interface.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: We believe in the power of
  typescript to ensure our code is robust and maintainable, and also as a way to
  provide a better developer experience through its language server and
  auto-completion.
- **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: We use Tailwind as our utility-first
  CSS framework. This allows us to build interfaces quickly and consistently,
  while leverating top-notch developer tooling and staying future-proof.
- **[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: We use shadcn as the basis for our
  components to make sure our baseline of components is powerful and accessible.
- **[Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives)**: We use Radix as the basis
  for our interaction primitives to make sure our components are accessible and
  consistent.

## How to use Factorial One?

Install Factorial one as a depencency:

```bash
$ npm install git+https://github.com/factorialco/factorial-one#release
```

Then, import its styles in your application (usually in `main.tsx` or similar):

```jsx
import "@factorialco/factorial-one/dist/styles.css"
```

Then, use any of its components:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@factorialco/factorial-one"
```
