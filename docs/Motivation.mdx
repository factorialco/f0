# Why do this?

**Context and problem:** How did we get here?

- Our current product has a huge surface area. Designers have created ad-hoc components to solve the problem at hand, without much consideration of how it affects the platform as a whole.
- This has created a never-ending series of bugs, inconsistencies and poor user experience for everyone involved (customers, designers, developers).
- Our product feels slow, chaotic, inconsistent and disconnected.

It’s time to do something about it!

**Business case:** What will be the outcome for the business?

1. **Upselling:** By unifying the pieces, the products are easier to connect. Users find familiarity as each product works and looks exactly the same.
2. **Mobile ready**: Younger generations of business owners operate from their mobile phones. By being responsive by default, we can tap into a whole new customer segment.
3. **Integrations:** We can expose the same UI toolkit that we use internally to partners than need to extend Factorial for local compliance. Or even external products that want to tap into our ecosystem (e.g. [Stripe external apps](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/design?locale=es-ES)).

# Principles

- As little choice as possible
- As little design as possible
- Get out of the way - don’t create more work for our users
- As abstract as possible. Navigation patterns and components are reusable and interchangeable. We rarely create anything ad-hoc.

# Scope

What is the scope? 

- UI Foundations (e.g. Tailwind UI, [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) — 100%
- Abstractions (e.g. data collections) — 80%/20%
    - Rendering (list, table, grid, etc…)
    - Filterting
    - Loading
- Navigation and Information Architecture
    - Access points
    - UX metaphors (e.g. My stuff vs. My company)

# Plan

1. Put together a small task force
    - Core: Josep Jauma, Dani Moreno, Mark MacKay, René Galindo
    - Close collaborators: TBD
2. Define the core foundations, abstractions and navigation that solve most of the current use-cases (aiming for 80%)
3. Gradually share and involve PDs and FE to redesign (or fit) their current product into the new foundation.
    - Work with them to find edge cases and things that don’t fit.
    - Iterate until we get 80% of the use-cases covered.
    - Seriously question the remaining 20%, then create ad-hoc components for valuable use cases for users and businesses.
4. Adoption and deployment: TBD

- Slack message from René:
    
    **Our product is chaotic, inconsistent, and disconnected.** The hard truth is that the origin of the problem is a lack of strong product design foundations. We have to radically change how we understand product design at Factorial.Note that product design is a collaboration between (primarily) designers and engineers, so we're both just as responsible for the current state of things.**We have to:**
    
    - Stop designing ad-hoc components for every single product and start thinking holistically across the whole system. Design for our platform, not for your product!
    - Stop reinventing the wheel every time and start embracing constraints as a driver of creativity and consistent design.
    - Stop thinking in only visual dimensions and start thinking in module components, data collections, paths, and everything that lies behind the screen.
    - Stop using Figma as the source of truth and start using it as a *rough* reference for what will be implemented. Storybook is a much better source of truth of what actually can get built!
