# Section Header

## Introduction

### Definition

The Section Header is a component used to organize and present content into
distinct sections in Factorial's interface. It provides a consistent structure
for displaying hierarchical information with titles, descriptions, and optional
elements.

### Purpose

- Structure and organize content sections
- Provide clear visual hierarchy
- Add contextual information when needed
- Enable basic interactions related to the section's content, such as help links
  or other complementary actions

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={SectionHeaderStories.Default} meta={SectionHeaderStories} />
<Controls of={SectionHeaderStories.Default} />

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Keep titles concise and descriptive, with 2-5 words and no punctuation
- Write descriptions with meaningful context in 1-2 sentences
- Use action verbs in [verb + noun] format (e.g., "Learn more" instead of "Help
  center link")
- Never punctuate labels and keep them short, with a maximum of one or two
  words.

### Design best practices

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description: "Use a section header when you need to:",
    guidelines: [
      "Introduce a new content section",
      "Provide simple hierarchical organization",
      "Add basic context to a specific section",
      "Link to help documentation when it would be valuable",
    ],
    children: (
      <img
        src="docs/headers/resource-header-do.png"
        alt="Example of correct section header usage showing pending tasks with clear hierarchy"
      />
    ),
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use a section header:",
    guidelines: [
      "To repeat the same information that is already in the module header",
      "When there's no clear need for visual hierarchy",
    ],
    children: (
      <img
        src="docs/headers/resource-header-dont.png"
        alt="Example of incorrect section header usage showing redundant task information"
      />
    ),
  }}
