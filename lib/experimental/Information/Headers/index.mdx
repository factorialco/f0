# Resource header

## Introduction

### Definition

The Resource Header is a structural component that provides context and key
actions for a resource page. It helps users understand where they are and what
actions they can perform.

### Purpose

- Provide immediate context about the current resource the user is viewing
- Centralize primary and secondary actions related to the resource
- Display crucial metadata and status information
- Create a consistent navigation pattern across different resource types

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={ResourceHeaderStories.Default} meta={ResourceHeaderStories} />
<Controls of={ResourceHeaderStories.Default} />

### Use case

### Common actions

#### Primary action

- Positioned far right of the header
- Primary actions vary by context (e.g., "Add members")
- Most visually prominent in the header
- Can include icons when they aid recognition or match design patterns

#### Edit

- Positioned between Primary and Destructive actions (when applicable)
- Must include the pencil icon (âœŽ)
- Uses an outline button type

#### Destructive

- Positioned far left of all buttons
- Always requires a
  [confirmation dialog](https://www.figma.com/design/pZzg1KTe9lpKTSGPUZa8OJ/Web-Components?node-id=1382-56231&t=qHSbsLBajafKBawc-1)
- Must include the trash icon (ðŸ—‘)
- Uses a critical button type with a "danger" color

## Variants

The Resource Header is designed to adapt to different types of content,
providing a clear and relevant presentation based on the context.

### Person

<Canvas of={PersonHeaderStories.Default} />

### Company

Designed for company, client and other entity profiles.

<Canvas of={CompanyHeaderStories.Default} />

### Bank Account

## Guidelines

### Content best practices

- Keep titles concise and descriptive (recommended: 2-5 words)
- Write descriptions that provide meaningful context (recommended: 1-2
  sentences)
- Use action verbs for button labels (e.g., "Edit profile" instead of "Profile
  edition")
- Ensure metadata labels are clear and consistent across the application

### Design best practices

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description: "Use Resource Header when you need to:",
    guidelines: [
      "Display key information about a specific resource (employee, project, document, course, job post, expense, performance review, etc.)",
      "Provide quick access to common actions related to the resource",
      "Show the current status and important metadata of a resource",
      "Create consistent navigation patterns across resource detail pages",
    ],
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use Resource Header when:",
    guidelines: [
      "You're displaying a data collection",
      "The page doesn't represent a specific resource",
      "You need minimal identification without actions or metadata",
      "You're creating a dashboard overview",
    ],
  }}
/>

## Behavior

### Scroll

The Resource Header implements a responsive scroll behavior that enhances
navigation and maintains context while preserving vertical space. The component
transitions between two states: expanded and collapsed.

## Resource metadata

Metadata are key elements for displaying contextual information about a
resource, allowing users to identify and interact with related data efficiently.
These actions are displayed in the header section and vary depending on the
context.

The metadata section displays key-value pairs with the following
characteristics:

- Label-Data pairs displayed horizontally
- Each pair consists of a label (grey text) followed by the corresponding data
- Multiple pairs can be displayed in a row (Recommended maximum: 5)
- Interactive elements within the metadata can trigger specific actions

### Variants

### Guidelines

#### Best practices

1. Maintain consistent labeling conventions
2. Group related metadata fields
3. Prioritize important information in the layout
4. Use clear, concise descriptions
5. Include relevant actions based on context

#### Uses cases

### Behavior

#### Hover interactions

The metadata fields reveal action options on hover. Each metadata can be
configured to show relevant actions based on the content type and use case.

When hovering over a metadata field, one or more of these actions may be
displayed:

- **Inline Edit**: Enables direct editing of the field content
- **Quick Copy**: Provides one-click copying of exact values (ideal for
  financial data, IBANs, account numbers)
- **Side Panel**: Opens a detailed view or complex editing interface
- **Tooltip Info**: Shows additional information or context when needed
