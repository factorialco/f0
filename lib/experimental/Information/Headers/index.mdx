## Introduction

### Definition

The Resource Header is a structural component that provides context and key
actions for a resource page. It helps users understand where they are and what
actions they can take.

### Purpose

- Provides immediate context about the current resource being viewed
- Centralizes primary and secondary actions related to the resource
- Displays crucial metadata and status information
- Creates a consistent navigation pattern across different resource types

# Guidelines

## Content best practices

- Keep titles concise and descriptive (recommended: 2-5 words)
- Write descriptions that provide meaningful context (recommended: 1-2
  sentences)
- Use action verbs for button labels (e.g., "Edit profile" instead of "Profile
  edition")
- Ensure metadata labels are clear and consistent across the application

## Design best practices

<DoDonts
  do={{
    description: "Use Resource Header when you need to:",
    guidelines: [
      "Display key information about a specific resource (employee, project, document, course, job post, expense, performance review, etc.)",
      "Provide quick access to common actions related to the resource",
      "Show the current status and important metadata of a resource",
      "Create consistent navigation patterns across resource detail pages",
    ],
  }}
  dont={{
    description: "Don't use Resource Header when:",
    guidelines: [
      "You're displaying a data collection",
      "The page doesn't represent a specific resource",
      "You need minimal identification without actions or metadata",
      "You're creating a dashboard overview",
    ],
  }}
/>
