<Meta of={DataListStories} title="DataList" />

# `DataList`

List of data items presented in a compact form. We recommend to use the
component in the information panel in the `InfoPaneLayout`. It can have a label
on the top.

<Canvas of={DataListStories.WithLabel} />

The list support four types of items:

- `DataList.Item` - a basic text with an optional icon on the left side;
- `DataList.PersonItem` - represents a user or an employee;
- `DataList.CompanyItem` - represents a company;
- `DataList.TeamItem` - represents a team;

## Actions

You can attach one predefined action to any item you render. The predefined
actions are:

- copy text of the item;
- navigate to another URL, internal or external;

To attach an action, pass an `action` prop to an item:

```tsx
<DataList>
  <DataList.Item text="hellen@factorial.co" action={{ type: "copy" }} />
  <DataList.Item
    action={{ type: "navigate", href: "https://factorialhr.com/" }}
    text="Factorial"
  />
</DataList>
```

Here is the list where all items are used with different actions:
