# Widgets

Widgets are components that can be used to display information, usually in a
card format. Its main purpose is to display information in a structured way,
providing a clear and concise overview of the data.

<Canvas of={WidgetStories.WithAction} meta={WidgetStories} />

## How to use

Widgets are meant to be used within a container, which is a component that
provides a context for the widget to live in.

An example of a container is the Dashboard, which is meant to display a big
amount of widgets with variable heights:

<Canvas of={DashboardStories.Small} />

Or the WidgetStrip, which is meant to display an horizontal list of widgets that
will show a horizontal scrollbar if there are too many to fit in the screen:

<Canvas of={WidgetStripStories.Default} />

## Loading states

Both widgets and containers can be in a loading state, which is a state that
indicates that the widget is still loading and its content is not yet ready.
Both variants provide a `Skeleton` component that can be used to display a
loading state.

### Widget.Skeleton

<Canvas of={WidgetSkeletonStories.Default} />

### Dashboard.Skeleton

<Canvas of={DashboardStories.Skeleton} />

### WidgetStrip.Skeleton

<Canvas of={WidgetStripStories.Skeleton} />

## Charts

There's a special type of widget that is meant to display data in a chart
format. It's a bit more complex than the other widgets, but it's still a widget.

<Canvas of={AreaChartWidgetStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={BarChartWidgetStories.Default} />

You can find more examples of charts in the
[charts section](/docs/experimental-widgets-charts-areachartwidget--docs).
