Avoid writing comments describing "what is it". Comments must be a rare thing, highlighting complex parts of the code.
They must answer to question "Why?"

# Styling Approach

- Use **Tailwind CSS** with a custom configuration for primary styling.
- Leverage **shadcn/ui** components as base primitives (avoid modifications unless necessary).
- Follow mobile-first responsive design.
- Utilize container queries where appropriate.

## Animation Strategy
- Use CSS animations/transitions for simple interactions.
- Leverage **Framer Motion** for complex animations and gestures.
- Use **tailwindcss-animate** for common animation patterns.

## Design Tokens Implementation
- Use Tailwind theme configuration.
- Follow **shadcn/ui** token conventions.
- Maintain consistent spacing and color scales.
