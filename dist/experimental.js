   * After this method is called, the type is also available on `ydoc.share.get(name)`.
   *
   * *Best Practices:*
   * Define all types right after the Y.Doc instance is created and store them in a separate object.
   * Also use the typed methods `getText(name)`, `getArray(name)`, ..
   *
   * @template {typeof AbstractType<any>} Type
   * @example
   *   const ydoc = new Y.Doc(..)
   *   const appState = {
   *     document: ydoc.getText('document')
   *     comments: ydoc.getArray('comments')
   *   }
   *
   * @param {string} name
   * @param {Type} TypeConstructor The constructor of the type definition. E.g. Y.Text, Y.Array, Y.Map, ...
   * @return {InstanceType<Type>} The created type. Constructed with TypeConstructor

It looks like you wrote ` + _ + `(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

` + _ + `(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    // You can await here
    const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
    // ...
  }
  fetchData();
}, [someId]); // Or [] if effect doesn't need props or state
