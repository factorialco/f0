It looks like you wrote ` + _ + `(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

` + _ + `(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    // You can await here
    const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
    // ...
  }
  fetchData();
}, [someId]); // Or [] if effect doesn't need props or state
