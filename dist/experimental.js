- A server/client branch \`if (typeof window !== 'undefined')\`.
- Variable input such as \`Date.now()\` or \`Math.random()\` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

It looks like you wrote ` + _ + `(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

` + _ + `(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    // You can await here
    const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
    // ...
  }
  fetchData();
}, [someId]); // Or [] if effect doesn't need props or state
