  fully covered parent nodes of the replaced region when they are

  This is the method, for example, to handle paste. The similar
  [`replace`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#transform.Transform.replace) method is a more
  primitive tool which will _not_ move the start and end of its given
  range, and is useful in situations where you need more precise
